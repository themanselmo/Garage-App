# Garage-App
### This project was an attempt to create an app similar to what may be used in a parking garage in New York City. 
### The data structures in the current build simply include two array lists, one containing all of the parking spots in the garage, and the other containing all of the accounts of the users.
### All in all, this project took me out of my comfort zone by stepping into the realm of mobile android development, but in the end I was able to create a functioning application that I could be proud of and update in the future.
